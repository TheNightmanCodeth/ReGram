  "body": "#Privacy Policy\r\nWe will never have access to your images, the images you repost, or your account information! The images are never seen by us, only you and instagram. We never see your login information, since we utilize Instagram's OAuth apis. Don't believe us? Check the source code! The images are grabbed securely from instagram's servers, and stored on your device for a limited time, only until the repost is complete. Once the image is no longer needed, it is deleted from your device. No middleman!\r\n\r\n#Motivation\r\nYou might be thinking, \"But there are plenty of repost apps for instagram, what makes yours so special?\" and that's a solid point. What sets us apart is that we don't watermark your reposts! Other repost apps insist on adding their logo to your images. That's fine, but we think that can take away from the image you're trying to share! Instead of coercing you into paying for a simple repost app, we throw some subtle, non-intrusive banner-style advertisements into the repost dialog. If you don't like them, you can get rid of them with a one time in-app-purchase!\r\n\r\n#Tutorial\r\nRePost for Instagram is extremely simple to use! Simply press the menu on the image you wish to repost, and select \"Copy share url\". That's it! If the user is private, you won't see the \"copy share url\" option. That's done on purpose, not by me, but by Instagram. Sorry!\r\n\r\nTODO: Add images\r\n",
